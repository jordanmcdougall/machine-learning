## Machine Learnig Definition

A computer program is said to learn from experience **E** with respect to some task **T** and some performance measure **P**, if its performance on **T**, as measured by **P**, improves with experience **E**.

Example: playing checkers.

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

T = the task of playing checkers.

P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

## Supervised Learning

The term Supervised Learning refers to the fact that we gave the algorithm a data set in which the "right answers" were given.

## Regression

The goal is to predict a continuous valued output.

## Classification

The goal is to predict a discrete value output.
